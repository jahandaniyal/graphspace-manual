# Forking Graphs

The Fork feature gives Users the ability to create a copy of other Graphs in GraphSpace. The User needs to be signed-in to GraphSpace in order to use this feature. [GraphSpace](http://www.graphspace.org) allows users to fork the following types of Graphs:

1. **Public Graphs** - Users can fork any and all public graphs.
2. **Shared Graphs** - Users can fork any graph which has been shared with them in some Group.

The following features are available in the Fork graph functionality:

- [Forked Graphs Tab](#forked-graph-tab)
- [Create a Fork](#create-a-fork)
- [Delete a Forked Graph](#delete-a-forked-graph)

## Forked Graphs Tab

The `Forked Graphs` tab displays information about the forked graphs in a table format. The table contains following columns:

1. **Graph Name** - Name of the forked graph.
2. **Tags** - Tags associated with the forked graph.
3. **Graph Owner** - Email address of the owner of the graph.
4. **Last Modified** - The time when the graph was last modified.
5. **Visibility** - Private or Public.
6. **Operations** - Allows users to remove a forked graph.

The image below shows an example of Forked Graphs Tab when a user clicks on the `Forked Graphs` tab link:
